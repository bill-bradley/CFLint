First, you need Apache Maven to be installed 
	http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

After you have maven installed you need to install cfml.parsing and cfml.dictionary to the local Maven repository
	1. Run the importlocalmaven.bat from the CFLint root.

	!!!This is where it gets kind of funky, since CFLint is looking for specific versions of the libraries!!!

	2. Open the .m2 folder for your computer user.
	3. Browse to the cfml folder.
	4. Inside here, copy the CFLint\lib jars to the corresponding subfolders.
	5. Rename the jar files to "cfml.dictionary-0.0.1.jar" and "cfml.parsing-0.0.1.jar"
	6. Open a command prompt, navigate to your CFLint root folder and build with:
		mvn clean install
	7. Hopefully you see a "BUILD SUCCESS"
